<h2>Who is this guy?</h2>
<img src="Images/rk.jpg" class="right"/ style="border: 1px solid black" />

<p>My name is Rickard Karlsson and I’ve played some Magic: the Gathering for quite some time now (opened my first booster at Portal Second Age). I live in Stockholm, Sweden and known as triss at our country’s best and biggest magic site: www.svenskamagic.com. Although work is consuming alot of time nowadays and I don’t attend that many tournaments anymore, I do try to play some GP:s och PTQ:s from time to time. To prepare for such events, I usually play some MtGO, nicking Zoizaite. I don’t have that much of magic accomplishments outside of Sweden, maybe besides a Pro Tour appearance at PT Born of the Gods in Valencia. </p>
<p>Outside of Magic, I work as an ICT Coach and a web devoloper at Södertörn University in Huddinge.</p>

<h2>Why this generator?</h2>
<p>
Because I really miss an interactive sealed deck generator on the net! Also, I really hate it when people are writing tournament reports about their sealed deck; they just list their 84-card pool and ask their readers how they would have built it. For me, that’s just sad, since it is such a huge contrast between a sealed deck on paper and having the cards in front of you. Hopefully, a generator like this gets you a little closer to the IRL experience. 
</p>
<p>And no, I don’t want take anything away from MtGO. On Magic Online (and IRL for that matter) you spend very little time on deckbuilding, and the matches will take most of your time. That means you don’t get to practice all that much on the deckbuilding itself, which hopefully this generator can change. Since this means no Magic gameplay, I hope Wizards don’t see the site as rival, but more like an magic enhancer. I want players to get better, be ready for MtGO’s sealed deck, and share deck building experience in a different way!
